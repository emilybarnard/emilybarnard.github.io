## Student Research

- **Research Advisor** 
   - Summer 2021 - Present. Worked closely with an undergraduate DePaul student to develop a research project at the intersection of poset topology and lattice theory of the weak order on $\mathfrak{S}_{n}$. This project has turned into a master’s thesis. 
   - Fall 2022 - Present. Continued a research extends findings from DePaul’s 2022 NREUP program with one of our undergraduate participants.
- **Co-Director of the [DePaul University Summer NREUP 2022](https://csh.depaul.edu/academics/mathematical-sciences/research/Pages/2022-NREUP.aspx).**   
   Acted as the lead research mentor for four undergraduate students funded through the [MAA NREUP grant](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/outreach-initiatives/nreup), and one student who was internally funded. Introduced students to relevant background and our main research questions. Met with them regularly throughout each day of the program to answer questions and provide direction and feedback. Acted as lead organizer for our final panel discussion on graduate school and careers in mathematics. Following the program, met with four of the five student researchers individually to practice and prepare for conference presentations.
- **Co-Organizer of the [Northeastern University RTG REU](https://sites.google.com/view/rtg-northeastern/undergraduate/independent-research-experience#h.p_uqYXhE7KeoxD), 2019.**   
   Paired high-performing undergraduate students with Ph.D. student mentors for experiential learning program. Together, groups prepared a research-calibre paper and oral presentation, specializing in areas of mathematics ranging from knot theory to chip-firing. Acted as lead administrator for the program, making final recommendations for salary, schedule, and outcomes for undergraduate and Ph.D. participants. Point of contact for graduate school administrator, RTG grant administrator, and department chair.

## Academic Advising and Faculty Support

- **McNair Scholar Advisor**, 2021 - 2022.   
   The [McNair Scholars Program](https://offices.depaul.edu/student-affairs/support-services/trio/mcnair-scholars-program/Pages/default.aspx) is a federally funded program designed to prepare first-generation and/or traditionally under-represented minorities for success in graduate studies. Work closely with advisee to discuss both research and scholarly opportunities, as well as opportunities for work-life balance and support.
- **Faculty organizer of the [Northeastern University Mathematics Club](https://neu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/math-club)**, 2017 - 2019.   
   Invited internal and external speakers to facilitate an interactive discussion on topics ranging from Ramsey Theory to “The the Dog Who Knows Calculus”. Each meeting, students worked directly with the speaker and in small groups to generate examples or solve problems.

## Outreach and Public Engagement

- *Posets from “Nature”*, Spring 2021.   
   [CSH 10 Year Anniversary Spotlight](https://csh.depaul.edu/about/anniversary/Pages/spotlight.aspx).
- *Spot It! Finding your place in the mathematical world*, Winter 2021.   
   Invited Speaker, [Northeastern University AWM Student Chapter](https://mathdept.sites.northeastern.edu/awm-student-chapter/), Boston, MA.
- *Math Teaching and Tutoring*, Winter 2021.   
   DePaul University Math Club.
- *The non-crossing game: Circle, Squares and Triangles...Oh my!* Fall 2020.   
   DePaul University Math Club.
- [Chicago Math Teachers Circle](https://mathcirclesofchicago.org/cmtc/) Speaker, Fall 2019.   
   Facilitated an evening session of professional development for Chicago-area teachers centered combinatorics, bijections, and the Catalan numbers. In a highly structured session, teachers began by exploring several related counted problems by generating concrete examples. Then, teachers shared their experimental data to find bijections between each of the objects they counted.
- *Dots and Squiggles*, Winter 2017.   
   Colloquium, Trinity College, Hartford, CT.
   The SUM Series, NC State University, Raleigh, NC.   
   Introduced the idea of counting mathematical objects using bijective maps. In the talk, we present a counting problem, and the audience helps to construct a bijective solution. We also touch on recent related research.
- *Polytopia*, 2016 - 2017.   
   Multiple presentations at NC State University and the [North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences](https://naturalsciences.org/).   
   Developed a hands-on demonstration aimed at exposing the general public to convex polytopes. Constructed simple props that were used to build hands-on examples. Demos were specifically aimed at reaching an audience that might not otherwise interact with university researchers.
