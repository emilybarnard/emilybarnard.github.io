I am an Assistant Professor at [DePaul University](https://depaul.edu) in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://csh.depaul.edu/academics/mathematical-sciences/Pages/default.aspx), located in Chicago, Illinois. My research interests are in algebraic combinatorics, which means I organize discrete data in ways that highlight useful structures or patterns. I am particularly interested in lattice theory in connection with Coxeter groups and representation theory.
