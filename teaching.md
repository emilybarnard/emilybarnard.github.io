My teaching style is heavily influenced by my scholarship in algebraic combinatorics and my personality.
As a reseacher, I am highly collaborative; many of my insights and accomplishments have come from group dsicussion.
But equally important is productive failure---describing and understanding those ideas that don't work.
As I approach teaching, I often look to recreate my experiences in *respectful* and productive research envirnoments.
After years of experiencing my own math-anxiety, I frame my class architecture around building trust and community.
