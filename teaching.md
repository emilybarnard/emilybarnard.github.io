My teaching style is heavily influenced by my scholarship in algebraic combinatorics and my personality. As a reseacher, I am highly collaborative; many of my insights and accomplishments have come from group dsicussion. But equally important is productive failure---describing and understanding those ideas that don't work. As I approach teaching, I often look to recreate my experiences in *respectful* and productive research envirnoments. After years of experiencing my own math-anxiety, I frame my class architecture around building trust and community.
